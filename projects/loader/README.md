# Loader

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.0.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project loader` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project loader`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project loader` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

THis will be used to show loaders on it.
